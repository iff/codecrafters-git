- all stages (and tests) completed, needs cleanup and still some corner cases
o pack
  x recursively resolve base_from
    x and delta offset still seems to have a bug (see verify-pack of git-sample-2) due to missing recursion?
    x related to not understanding magic offset that seems to be necessary (read the docs again)
  x cleanup types for OffsetDelta and RefDelta
  o add more documentation and links to formats
  - add more tests
  - proper error handling: remove all the unwrap() shortcuts
    - nom error handling
  - too much is pub at the moment
- object
  - refactor object types and parsing from/to (currently a lot of manual code everywhere)
- commit tree
  - get author from env or config
- clone
  - move checkout to own mod and implement git checkout (extend sloppy checkout we have now)
  - check crc
  - write pack and idx files to disk (instead of all objects)
